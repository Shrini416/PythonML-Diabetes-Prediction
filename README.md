# PythonML-Diabetes-Prediction
To build a predictive system that can accurately determine whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical features 
(Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age).

Data Overview:
The dataset you're working with contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times a person has been pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that represents a person's genetic predisposition to diabetes.
Age: The person's age.
